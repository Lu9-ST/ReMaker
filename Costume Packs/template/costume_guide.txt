-BE SURE TO SAVE IT AS A 32-BIT PNG OTHERWISE THE TRANSPARENCY WILL NOT WORK-

CUSTOM SOUNDS:
if you want to add custom sound effects to the costume, just add OGG files
to the folder with the respective names:
appeal.ogg
dead.ogg
flagpole.ogg
jump.ogg
powerup.ogg
shoot.ogg (optional)
if you don't set any custom sounds the default sounds will play.

NAME:
For the name that displays on the costume picker, create a txt file named "name.txt"
with the name. use "#" for newline. (i.e. "Character#(Series)")

PROJECTILE:
if you want your character to shoot projectiles, edit the projectile.png, which has
4 frames.
and make a txt file named "projectile.txt", and input one of the following numbers
in it for its shooting style:
0 (Bouncing, like the original Mario Fireball)
1 (Continuous, like a Bullet)
2 (Gravity, like the hammer from SMB3)

IMPORTANT NOTES/TIPS:
-DON'T forget anything that's NOT optional or there might be errors in-game.
-It is encouraged to include the costumes used in a course when sharing it, with the
costume folder being the number of it, as the course file stores the costume NUMBERS,
otherwise people are most likely to get the wrong costumes in the level or maybe even get an error.
This MIGHT change in the future.
-For better costume editing, if you have Game Maker 8/Game Maker Studio, import the sheet.png on
the sprite editor as a strip, and edit from there. That way it is easier to stay in frames and
center the sprites as they should.
